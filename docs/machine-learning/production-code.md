- Python for software development and Python for scripting is not exactly the same beast.
    - Scripting is (mostly) the code you write for yourself. 
    - Software is the assemblage of code you (and other teammates) write for others.
- Software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience.
- Production quality code describes code that meets expectations for production.
    
## Refactoring

- Restructuring code to change its internal structure, without changing its external functionality.
- Pays off by speeding up development time in the long run.
- Helps becoming a stronger programmer when constantly looking to improve the code.
- First get the sh*t done, and only then refactor.

#### General tips

- Turn repetitive code blocks into utility functions.
- Think carefully about the API of the functions (required/optional parameters)
- Use the `*args` and `**kwargs` arguments to add more flexibility to functions.
- Write docstrings to explain the function and its parameters, and provide an example.
- Turn an object into a class if you start accumulating many utility functions related to it.
- Extend class functionality whenever possible using inheritance.
- Switch over to a new, clean notebook after defining a bunch of utility functions.
- Put `__init__.py` in the same directory to make the package importable.
- Build the habit of modularizing your work to be easily reused and extended by anyone.
- Contribute your own methods to community-owned packages such as NumPy and TensorFlow.

include a README file detailing the files in your package and how to install the package.
Comment your code - use docstrings and inline comments where appropriate.
Refactor code when possible - if you find your functions are getting too long, then refactor your code!
Use object-oriented programming whenever it makes sense to do so.
You're encouraged to write unit tests! The coding exercises in this lesson contained unit tests, so you can use those tests as a model for your package.
Use GitHub for version control, and commit your work often.

#### Writing clean code

> Can I understand the code easily?  
Does it use meaningful names and whitespace?  

- Clean code: 
    - Readable, simple, and concise. 
    - Crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.
- Use meaningful names:
    - For booleans, you can prefix with `is_` or `has_` to make it clear it is a condition.
    - Use part of speech to imply types, like verbs for functions and nouns for variables.
    - Avoid abbreviations and especially single letters (except counters and common math variables) 
    - Certain variables may be common knowledge among data scientists, but it might be necessary to provide more descriptive names for software engineers.
    - Names should be descriptive, but only with relevant information.
- Use whitespace properly:
    - Organize code with consistent indentation (4 spaces)
    - Separate sections with blank lines to keep the code well organized and readable.
    - Limit the lines to around 79 characters, which is the guideline given in the PEP 8 style guide. 
- [PEP 8 guidelines for code layout](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#code-lay-out)

```py
# Example: Variable names not consistent

t = end_time - start  # compute execution time
c = category(t)  # get category of task
print('Task Duration: {} seconds, Category: {}'.format(t, c)
```

```py
# Example: Clean code

execution_time = end_time - start_time
category = categorize_task(execution_time)
print('Task Duration: {} seconds, Category: {}'.format(execution_time, category)
```

#### Writing modular code

> Is there any duplicated code?  
Can you provide another layer of abstraction?  
Is there any function or module unnecessary?  
Is there any function or module too long?

- Modular code:
    - Logically broken up into functions and modules. 
    - Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported.
    - Makes code more organized, efficient, and reusable.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
    - Modularization allows reusing parts of code. 
    - Generalize and consolidate repeated code in functions or loops.
- Abstract out logic to improve readability:
    - But it is possible to over-engineer things and have way too many modules.
- Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.):
    - Creating more modules doesn't necessarily result in effective modularization.
    - There are tradeoffs to having function calls instead of inline logic. 
    - An unnecessary amount of entities forces you to jump around everywhere.
- Functions should do one thing:
    - If a function is doing multiple things, it becomes more difficult to generalize and reuse. 
    - Generally, if there's an `_and_` in your function name, consider refactoring.
- Try to use fewer than three arguments per function (there are exceptions, matplotlib?)

#### Writing efficient code

> Are there loops or other steps we can vectorize?  
Can we use better data structures to optimize any steps?  
Can we shorten the number of calculations needed for any steps?  
Can we use generators or multiprocessing to optimize any steps?

- Optimizing code to be more efficient can mean making it:
    - Execute faster (especially on larger data)
    - Take up less space in memory/storage.

## Documentation

> Are the in-line comments concise and meaningful?  
Is there any complex code that's missing documentation?  
Does every function use effective docstrings?  
Is the necessary project documentation provided?

- An additional text or illustrated information that comes with or is embedded in the code of software.
- Helpful for:
    - Clarifying complex parts of code.
    - Making code easier to navigate.
    - Quickly conveying how and why different components of program are used.
- Writing documentation helps improving the code design, as you're forced to think through your design decisions more thoroughly. 

#### In-line comments

- Used is to document the major steps of complex code to help readers follow.
- Comments are valuable for explaining where code cannot (why it is implemented a specific way?)
- But sometimes, if code requires comments to follow, it is a sign that refactoring is needed.

#### Docstrings

- Documentation strings explain the purpose and functionality of a function or module.
- Each function should always have a docstring.
- The first line of the docstring is a brief explanation of the function's purpose.

```py
# Example: One line docstring

def population_density(population, land_area):
    """Calculate the population density of an area."""
    return population / land_area
```

- The next elements of a docstring is an explanation of the function's arguments and output.
- You can add whatever details you want in a docstring (it's optional)

```py
# Example: Multi line docstring

def population_density(population, land_area):
    """Calculate the population density of an area.

    Args:
    population: int. The population of the area
    land_area: int or float. This function is unit-agnostic.

    Returns:
    population_density: population/land_area. The population density of a particular area.
    """
    return population / land_area
```

- [NumPy Docstring Guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)

#### Project Documentation

- Project documentation is essential for getting others to understand why code is relevant to them.
- A great first step in project documentation is README file (for first interaction with the user)
- README explains what it does, lists its dependencies, and provides instructions on how to use it. 
    - Also allows future contributors to know how to follow your original intentions.
    - [About READMEs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes)

## Git

- Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code.
- [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- [About merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-conflicts/)

#### Model Versioning

- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
    - [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org)
- Version control in data science can be tricky.
    - [How to Version Control Your Production Machine Learning Models](https://blog.algorithmia.com/how-to-version-control-your-production-machine-learning-models/)
    - [Versioning Data Science](https://shuaiw.github.io/2017/07/30/versioning-data-science.html)

## Testing

> Does the code have high test coverage?  
> Do the tests check for interesting cases?  
> Are the tests readable?  
> Can the tests be made more efficient?

- Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements.
- Testing is essential before deployment. 
- Helps catching errors and faulty conclusions before they make any major business impact.
- Problems that could occur in data science arenâ€™t always easily detectable:
    - Values being encoded incorrectly
    - Features being used inappropriately
    - Unexpected data breaking assumptions
- [Four Ways Data Science Goes Wrong and How Test Driven Data Analysis Can Help](https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/four-ways-data-science-goes-wrong-and-how-test-driven-data-analysis-can-help/6947/)
- [Ned Batchelder: Getting Started Testing](https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/getting-started-testing-by-ned-batchelder)

#### Unit tests

- Unit testing involves breaking the program into pieces, and subjecting each piece to a series of (independent) tests.
- The advantage of unit tests is that they are isolated, thus, no dependencies are involved. 
    - They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources.
- However, passing unit tests isnâ€™t always enough to prove that the program is working successfully. 
- Use integration tests to test whether they are communicating and transferring data correctly.
    - [Integration Testing](https://www.fullstackpython.com/integration-testing.html)
- Testing with pytest:
    - Create a test file starting with `test_`
    - Define unit test functions that start with `test_` inside the test file.
    - It's wise to have only one `assert` statement per test.
    - Run `pytest` in the directory of the defined test files.
- [Unit Testing](https://www.fullstackpython.com/unit-testing.html)

#### Test-driven development

- The Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software engineering practice that requires unit tests to be written before the code they are supposed to validate.
    - [Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92)
    - [Testing Your Code](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/)
- Tests can check for all the different scenarios and edge cases before even starting to code.
    - The test then can be run to get immediate feedback on whether it works or not.
- TDD for data science is relatively new and has a lot of experimentation and breakthroughs appearing.

## Logging

> Are log messages clear, concise, and professional?  
Do they include all relevant and useful information?  
Do they use the appropriate logging level?  

- Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs (e.g. over night)
- Good examples of log messages:
    - Be professional and clear: "Couldn't parse file"
    - Be concise and use normal capitalization: "Generating product recommendations"
    - Provide any useful information: "Failed to read location data: store_id 8324971"
    - Choose the appropriate level for logging: `DEBUG` (anything that happens), `ERROR` (any error that occurs), `INFO` (any user-driven or system-specific operation)

## Code review

- Represents the process of reviewing someone's code before it gets merged.
- [Code Review](https://github.com/lyst/MakingLyst/tree/master/code-reviews)
- [Code Review Best Practices](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html)

#### Tips for conducting a code review

- Using a Python code linter like pylint for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines.
- Agree on a style guide as a team to handle disagreements on code style.
- Rather than commanding people to change their code a specific way, explain to them the consequences of the current code and suggest changes to improve it.
- Promote a constructive discussion, rather than opposition.

> **BAD**: Make model evaluation code its own module - too repetitive.  
**GOOD**: How about we consider making the model evaluation code its own module? This would simplify models.py to only include code for building models. Organizing these evaluations methods into separate functions would also allow us to reuse them with different models without repeating code.

- Avoid comments that sound personal to bring the attention of the review to the code.

> **BAD**: I wouldn't groupby genre twice like you did here... Just compute it once and use that for your aggregations.  
**GOOD**: Can we group by genre at the beginning of the function and then save that as a groupby object? We could then reference that object to get the average prices and views without computing groupby twice.

- When providing a code review, write out code suggestions.

> **BAD**: You can do this all in one step by using the pandas str.split method.  
**GOOD**: We can actually simplify this step to the line below using the pandas str.split method. Found this on this stack overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14745022/how-to-split-a-column-into-two-columns

## Pythonic OOP

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) has a few benefits over procedural programming:
    - Allows to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time.
    - Hides the implementation from the end-user.
- Classes, object, attributes, methods, and inheritance are common to all OOP languages.
- [A Basic Tutorial on Python Classes and Objects](https://jobtensor.com/Tutorial/Python/en/Classes-Objects)
- [Java OOPs Concepts](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts)

#### Pythonic way

> **For a Java guy**: Python is an anarchic playgound where anyone can grab a club and start mauling your head.  
**For a Python guy**: Java is a an Orwellian universe where you are constantly shackled to someone else`s diminishing view of how the universe tick.

- Python packages like Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy are built using OOP principles.
- [When should I be using classes in Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33072570/when-should-i-be-using-classes-in-python#answer-33072722)

#### Attributes and methods

- The general OOP convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values.
    - These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods.
    - Changing values via a method provides more flexibility in the long-term.
- Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages but not in Python.
    - The underscore in front of a variable means it can should be accessed with get and set.
    - `_` prefix means stay away even if you're not technically prevented from doing so.
- Python does not distinguish between private and public variables.
    - To emulate private variables for some reason, you can always use the `__` prefix from PEP 8.
- [Python's Instance, Class, and Static Methods Demystified](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php)

#### Inheritance

- Inheritance helps organize code with a more general version of a class and then specific children.
    - Inheritance can make object-oriented programs more efficient to write.
    - Updates to a parent class automatically trickle down to its children.
    - [Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
- A mixin is a special kind of multiple inheritance, used when:
    - You want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
    - You want to use one particular feature in a lot of different classes.
    - [Mixins for Fun and Profit](https://easyaspython.com/mixins-for-fun-and-profit-cb9962760556)

#### Magic functions and decorators

- Magic functions allow us to override or add the default functionality of python objects.
    - For example, one can do `class_1+class_2` to build a new class.
    - [A Guide to Python's Magic Methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/)
- Decorator adds new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.
    - Syntactic Sugar with `@`!
    - For example, a `@timer` decorator can measure the time a function takes.
    - [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)

## Packaging

- A package is a collection of Python modules.
- A module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality.
- Packaging is all about target environment and deployment experience.
    - [How To Package Your Python Code](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    - [An Overview of Packaging for Python](https://packaging.python.org/overview/#packaging-applications)

#### Virtual environments

- When installing your package locally, consider setting up a virtual environment.
- A virtual environment is a silo-ed Python installation apart from the main Python installation.
    - One can install and delete the virtual environment without any side effects.
- Conda does two things: manages packages and manages environments.
    - Makes it easy to manage Python packages especially for data science.
    - Created to manage data science packages that relied on libraries outside of Python.

```bash
# Example: conda

$ conda create --name env_name
$ source activate env_name
```

- venv is an environment manager that comes pre-installed with Python 3.
- Pip is the main package-management system used to install and manage Python packages.
    - Can only manage Python packages whereas conda is a language agnostic package manager.
- Both tend to be used for generic software development projects including web development.
    - [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/)

```bash
# Example: virtualenv

$ python3 -m venv env_name
$ source env_name/bin/activate
```

#### PyPi

- [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
- If your open-source code isnâ€™t on PyPI, it is harder for other developers to find and use it.

```bash
# Example: Packaging to PyPi

$ cd your_package
$ python setup.py sdist
$ pip install twine

# Commands to upload to the PyPi test repository
$ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your_package_name

# Command to upload to the PyPi repository
$ twine upload dist/*
$ pip install your_package_name
```
